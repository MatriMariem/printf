_PRINTF
NAME _printf - does formatted printing of text
SYNOPSIS: _printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
DESCRIPTION
_printf prints the FORMAT string, interpreting ‘%’ directives and ‘\’ escapes to format numeric and string arguments in a way that is mostly similar to the C ‘printf’ function.
FORMAT controls the output as in C printf.  Interpreted sequences are:
\n	new line
\t	horizontal tab
%%	a single %
%c	next argument of type Char
%s	next argument of type Char *
%i	next argument of type int
%d	next decimal argument
%b	converts int argument into binary
%r	prints the reversed string
%R	prints the Rot13'ed string
NOTE: a single % at the end of FORMAT string is interpreted as error.
NOTE: a single % followed by unknown specifier is not interpreted.
